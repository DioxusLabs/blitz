  # MSRV check.
  # Blitz only guarantees "latest stable". However we have this check here to ensure that we advertise
  # our MSRV. We also make an effort not to increase MSRV in patch versions of Blitz.
  #
  # We only run `cargo build` (not `cargo test`) so as to avoid requiring dev-dependencies to build with the MSRV
  # version. Building is likely sufficient as runtime errors varying between rust versions is very unlikely.
